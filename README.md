# Pytorch Tobit & Truncated Linear Regression

This is a pytorch-based implementation of censored regression (tobit regression) and truncated regression on batched data.

The speed would be significantly faster than using for-loops on cpu when the batch-size is large.

## Requirements

Pytorch >= 1.6.0

GPyTorch >= 1.1.1
